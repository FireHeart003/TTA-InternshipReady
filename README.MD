# TTA Open Source Contribution Project ( Nathan Chen )
# Hackathon Website Template

### Contributions
- For the TTA Micro Credential, my team and I will be making commits to the official TTA-hackathon website repository (this is forked repo)
- We will be focusing on the various issues available in the official repo and reflecting the changes made in this branch 

### Licensing
- No license was found for the project I am contributing to, but the MIT License allows others to do almost anything with your project, like making and distributing closed-source versions. 
- This makes it suitable for most open-source projects.
